                Hello, my name is Michael Benefiel. I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 27, 1986. I attended Iowa State University with a B.S. in Psychology and minor in Sociology.
                <br>
                <br>After college, I received a job working in Los Angeles. I worked as a Transcriptions Manager at a major film studio. I freelanced at several post production studios, as well. During my time in Los Angeles, I often worked on short films during my free time. Much of this was pro bono work; however, I eventually turned them into paid gigs.
                <br>
                <br> I became disenchanted with Los Angeles after a few years, and decided to turn my focus towards a more steady career. That pursuit got me to Washington, D.C., where I initially worked as a copy editor and transcriber for an internal news service. We covered Congressional hearings, etc. This was at the height of the Great Recession, and I was forced to look for other work during this time. I eventually started working on political campaigns. My first campaign was for an individual running for the Virginia House of Delegates (just like a state rep). We won the election, and I started to work as his legislative aide. I also worked on a US Senate race in Arizona during this time.
                <br>
                <br> Long story short... I became disenchanted with politics and landed a gig with the United Way. Fast forward some more, and I'm working as a government affairs director for a trade association in KC. I'm currently a Marketing Manager with a local insurance brokerage firm.
                <br>
                <br> During this time, I've acquired years of marketing, PR, communications and basic coding skills. I see my future in software engineering, web development or something similar. So here I am.
